Py-Imagineer
============

*Image decoding and encoding implemented in Python (without native dependencies)*

* The project exists only for educational purposes
* Any usage in production is **not** recommened
* The code might be really slow (*libjpeg* will do work much faster for example),
  due to slow IO and bit operations in scripting languages
* If you really need imaging in Python, then you probably need `Pillow <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow>`_ or `Pil-Lite <https://github.com/alexa-infra/pil-lite>`_ ;)
